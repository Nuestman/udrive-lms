# Feedback, Reviews & Testimonials Redesign

## Scope

Restructure the experience so platform feedback remains an internal insight loop, course/school reviews capture public sentiment with controlled triggers, and testimonials become curated marketing assets. Aligns with industry distinctions between feedback, reviews, and testimonials.[^1][^2][^3]

## Steps

1. data-model

- Keep `reviews` table for public course/school reviews; add `visibility` & `source_review_id` fields to mark content surfaced externally.
- Introduce `platform_feedback` table capturing structured answers (ratings + short text) tied to UX/usability metrics.
- Add `testimonials` table referencing approved reviews/feedback with marketing copy, display flags, and placement metadata.
- Add course-level config for review prompts (e.g., percentage, lesson count, manual trigger flag).

2. backend-api

- Create `/api/feedback/platform` endpoints for submitting structured feedback and reporting aggregate KPIs.
- Refine `/api/reviews` to focus on public-facing course/school reviews (moderation, visibility toggle).
- Add `/api/testimonials` endpoints for curation (approve, edit narrative, feature ordering).
- Extend course settings endpoints to manage in-course review prompt rules; update middleware to respect tenant scope.

3. frontend-user-experience

- Replace existing `/feedback` page with guided platform feedback survey (Likert-scale questions + optional comments + quick follow-up chips).
- Build contextual course/school review modals triggered per course-config; store completion state per user-course.
- Show course reviews tab in learner course view (sortable list, average rating, filter by version/module).
- Update dashboard nav labels to clarify “Feedback” (internal) vs “Reviews” (public) vs “Testimonials”.

4. admin-ops

- Add admin console sections:
- Feedback analytics dashboard (charts, question heatmaps).
- Reviews moderation queue (existing but updated for visibility flags, link to trigger rules).
- Testimonials manager (select source review/feedback, edit headline/story, set placements).
- Provide export/download options for each channel.

5. migration-rollout

- Write migrations for new tables/columns; backfill existing reviews into new structure (set defaults for visibility, map pending items).
- Seed default feedback questions; handle translation/localization placeholders.
- Update docs outlining channel differences, governance, and marketing workflow.

## Todos

- data-model: Split storage into feedback, reviews, testimonials + course prompt configs
- backend-api: Implement new endpoints & adjust moderation logic per channel
- frontend-user-experience: Build distinct UI flows (platform survey, course prompts, review tabs)
- admin-ops: Deliver dashboards for insight, moderation, testimonial curation
- migration-rollout: Execute migrations, seed defaults, update documentation
