# 🎉 Week 2: Courses Management COMPLETE!

## Major Achievement!

You now have a **FULLY FUNCTIONAL course management system** connected to PostgreSQL!

---

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. Backend Infrastructure
**Middleware** (Professional-grade):
- ✅ `auth.middleware.js` - JWT authentication
- ✅ `rbac.middleware.js` - Role-based permissions
- ✅ `tenant.middleware.js` - Multi-tenant isolation
- ✅ `errorHandler.js` - Global error handling

**Courses Service** (`server/services/courses.service.js`):
- ✅ `getCourses()` - List all courses for tenant
- ✅ `getCourseById()` - Get single course with details
- ✅ `getCourseWithContent()` - Course with modules/lessons
- ✅ `createCourse()` - Create new course
- ✅ `updateCourse()` - Update course
- ✅ `deleteCourse()` - Delete course (with safety checks)
- ✅ `publishCourse()` - Publish draft course
- ✅ `getCourseStats()` - Course analytics

**API Routes** (`server/routes/courses.js`):
- ✅ `GET /api/courses` - List courses
- ✅ `GET /api/courses/:id` - Get course
- ✅ `GET /api/courses/:id/full` - Course with content
- ✅ `GET /api/courses/:id/stats` - Course statistics
- ✅ `POST /api/courses` - Create course
- ✅ `PUT /api/courses/:id` - Update course
- ✅ `DELETE /api/courses/:id` - Delete course
- ✅ `POST /api/courses/:id/publish` - Publish course

### 2. Frontend Integration
**React Hook** (`src/hooks/useCourses.ts`):
- ✅ Fetch courses from API
- ✅ Create course
- ✅ Update course
- ✅ Delete course
- ✅ Publish course
- ✅ Refresh courses
- ✅ Local state management
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Loading states

**Components**:
- ✅ `CoursesPage.tsx` - Main courses page with real data
- ✅ `CreateCourseModal.tsx` - Create course form
- ✅ `EditCourseModal.tsx` - Edit course form

**Type Definitions** (`src/types/database.types.ts`):
- ✅ Complete TypeScript interfaces for all database tables
- ✅ Type-safe API responses
- ✅ IntelliSense support

## 🎯 Test It NOW!

### Step 1: Restart Servers

Your servers should auto-reload (nodemon + HMR), but if needed:
```bash
# Stop (Ctrl+C) and restart:
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Courses

1. **Login** to your account (if not already)
2. **Click "Courses"** in the sidebar
3. **You should see:** 3 real courses from database!
   - Basic Driving Course
   - Advanced Defensive Driving
   - Traffic Laws Review

**NO MORE MOCK DATA!** 🎉

### Step 3: Create a Course

1. **Click "Create Course"** button
2. **Fill in:**
   - Title: "Test Course from UI"
   - Description: "This is a real course!"
   - Duration: 4 weeks
   - Price: 199.99
3. **Click "Create Course"**

**Watch your terminal:**
```
[0] POST /api/courses
[0] Executed query { text: 'INSERT INTO courses...', rows: 1 }
```

**Result:** Course appears immediately in the list!

### Step 4: Edit a Course

1. **Hover over a course card**
2. **Click the ⋮ (three dots)**
3. **Click "Edit"**
4. **Change the title**
5. **Click "Save Changes"**

**Watch terminal:**
```
[0] PUT /api/courses/:id
[0] Executed query { text: 'UPDATE courses...', rows: 1 }
```

**Result:** Title updates instantly!

### Step 5: Verify in Database

Open pgAdmin:
```sql
SELECT id, title, status, created_at 
FROM courses 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**You should see your new course!** 📊

### Step 6: Delete a Course (Admin only)

1. **Click ⋮ on a test course**
2. **Click "Delete"**
3. **Confirm**

**Watch terminal:**
```
[0] DELETE /api/courses/:id
```

**Result:** Course removed from list AND database!

## 🔥 What Makes This Different

### Before (Week 1):
```javascript
// CoursesPage.tsx
const sampleCourses = [
  { id: '1', title: 'Fake Course', ... }  // ← Hardcoded
];
```

### After (Week 2):
```typescript
// CoursesPage.tsx
const { courses, createCourse, updateCourse, deleteCourse } = useCourses();
// ↑ Real data from PostgreSQL!
```

**Complete data flow:**
```
UI Click → React Hook → API Call → Express Route → 
Service Layer → Database Query → PostgreSQL → 
Response → State Update → UI Refresh
```

**Every step is REAL!** ✅

## 🎓 What You Learned

This is the **pattern for all other features**:

```
1. Backend Service (courses.service.js)
   ↓
2. API Routes (courses.js)
   ↓
3. React Hook (useCourses.ts)
   ↓
4. UI Components (CoursesPage.tsx)
   ↓
5. CRUD Modals (Create/Edit)
```

**Replicate this for:**
- Students (Week 3)
- Enrollments (Week 3)
- Quizzes (Week 5)
- Certificates (Week 7)
- etc.

---

## 📈 Progress Update

**Before Week 2:**
- Overall: 40%
- Working features: Authentication only
- Mock data: Everything else

**After Week 2:**
- Overall: **55%** (+15%)
- Working features: Authentication + **Courses Management**
- Mock data: Students, Progress, Quizzes, etc. (coming soon)

## 🎯 Test Checklist

Test these scenarios:

- [ ] View courses page - shows 3 seeded courses
- [ ] Search for "Basic" - filters to 1 course
- [ ] Filter by "Published" - shows only published
- [ ] Click "Create Course" - modal opens
- [ ] Fill form and submit - course created
- [ ] See new course in list - appears instantly
- [ ] Open pgAdmin - new course in database
- [ ] Edit a course - changes save
- [ ] Refresh page - changes persist
- [ ] Delete a course - removes from list and DB
- [ ] Try as student role - can't see create button

## 🐛 If Something's Wrong

### Courses Don't Load
**Check:**
1. Backend running? (Terminal should show logs)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Check Network tab - API call successful?

**Debug:**
```bash
# Test API directly
curl http://localhost:5000/api/courses
```

### Can't Create Course
**Check:**
1. Backend logs for errors
2. Validation messages
3. User role (must be admin/instructor)

**Debug:** Check browser console and backend terminal

### Changes Don't Persist
**Check:**
1. Database connection
2. Run: `node database/test-connection.js`
