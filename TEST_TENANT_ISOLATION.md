# 🧪 Test Tenant Isolation - Complete Guide

## How to Test Everything

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Update Seed Data (Optional)

Run this SQL in pgAdmin to verify data integrity:

```sql
-- Check for data without tenant_id
SELECT 
  'Users without tenant (non-super admin)' as issue,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM user_profiles
WHERE role != 'super_admin' AND tenant_id IS NULL;

-- Should return 0
```

---

## 🎯 Step 2: Test Super Admin Access

### A. Make Yourself Super Admin
```sql
-- Run in pgAdmin
UPDATE user_profiles 
SET role = 'super_admin' 
WHERE email = 'nuestman17@gmail.com';
```

### B. Login and Watch Terminal
```
Expected log:
🔓 Super Admin Access: nuestman17@gmail.com - No tenant restrictions
```

### C. Test Navigation
```
1. Sidebar shows 13 links (all features)
2. Click "Schools" → SchoolsPage loads
3. Click "All Courses" → See all courses
4. Click "All Students" → See all students
5. Terminal shows NO tenant filtering queries
```

### D. Create a School
```
1. Schools page → "Create School"
2. Fill:
   - Name: "Test Academy"
   - Subdomain: "test-academy"
   - Email: "test@academy.com"
3. Click "Create School"
4. See school appear in grid
5. Stats show: 0 students, 0 courses
```

## 🔒 Step 3: Test School Admin Isolation

### A. Create School Admin for Testing
```sql
-- Run in pgAdmin - Create a school admin in your tenant
INSERT INTO user_profiles (
  email, 
  password_hash, 
  first_name, 
  last_name, 
  role, 
  tenant_id, 
  is_active
) VALUES (
  'schooladmin@test.com',
  '$2a$10$YourHashedPasswordHere', -- Use actual bcrypt hash
  'School',
  'Admin',
  'school_admin',
  '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000', -- Your tenant ID
  true
);
```

### B. Login as School Admin
```
1. Login with schooladmin@test.com
2. Check terminal:
   Expected: 🔒 Tenant Isolation: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000

3. Navigate to Courses:
   Expected: See ONLY courses from their school
   Terminal: WHERE c.tenant_id = $1

4. Check sidebar:
   Expected: NO "Schools" link (super admin only)
```

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Test Cross-Tenant Security

### A. Create Second School (as Super Admin)
```
1. Login as super admin
2. Schools → Create School
3. Name: "Second School"
4. Subdomain: "second-school"
```

### B. Create Admin for Second School
```sql
-- Get the new school's ID first
SELECT id, name FROM tenants WHERE subdomain = 'second-school';

-- Create admin for that school
INSERT INTO user_profiles (
  email, 
  password_hash,
  first_name,
  last_name,
  role,
  tenant_id,
  is_active
) VALUES (
  'admin@second-school.com',
  '$2a$10$ValidHashHere',
  'Second',
  'Admin',
  'school_admin',
  '{second_school_tenant_id}', -- Use actual ID from SELECT above
  true
);
```

### C. Test Isolation
```
1. Login as admin@second-school.com
2. Terminal: 🔒 Tenant Isolation: {second_school_id}

3. Create course "Second School Course"
4. Logout

5. Login as schooladmin@test.com (first school)
6. Terminal: 🔒 Tenant Isolation: {first_school_id}

7. Go to Courses
8. Expected: "Second School Course" is NOT visible!

9. Super admin login
10. Expected: Sees BOTH schools' courses!
```
