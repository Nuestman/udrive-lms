# 🔒 Tenant Isolation Implementation - Complete!

## Status: IMPLEMENTED ✅

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Updated Tenant Middleware** ✅

**File:** `server/middleware/tenant.middleware.js`

**Changes:**
```javascript
// Super Admin: No tenant restrictions
if (userProfile.role === 'super_admin') {
  req.tenantId = null;  // null = all tenants
  req.isSuperAdmin = true;
  console.log(`🔓 Super Admin Access: No tenant restrictions`);
}

// Others: Strict isolation
else {
  req.tenantId = userProfile.tenant_id;
  req.isSuperAdmin = false;
  console.log(`🔒 Tenant Isolation: ${req.tenantId}`);
}
```

**Security Features:**
- ✅ Super admin bypass with `req.isSuperAdmin = true`
- ✅ Strict tenant validation for non-super users
- ✅ Rejects users without tenant_id
- ✅ Logging for security audits

---

### 2. **Updated Courses Service** ✅

**File:** `server/services/courses.service.js`

**getCourses():**
```javascript
// Super Admin: See ALL courses with school names
if (isSuperAdmin) {
  SELECT c.*, t.name as school_name
  FROM courses c
  LEFT JOIN tenants t ON c.tenant_id = t.id
  // NO WHERE clause - all tenants
}

// Others: Only their courses
else {
  SELECT c.*
  FROM courses c
  WHERE c.tenant_id = $1  // Strict filtering
}
```

**getCourseById():**
- Super Admin: Can access any course
- Others: Must belong to their tenant

---

### 3. **Updated Courses Routes** ✅

**File:** `server/routes/courses.js`

**Changed:**
```javascript
// Before:
getCourses(req.tenantId)

// After:
getCourses(req.tenantId, req.isSuperAdmin)
```

All routes now pass `req.isSuperAdmin` flag.

---

### 4. **Fixed SQL Ambiguity Bug** ✅

**File:** `server/services/analytics.service.js`

**Issue:** `column reference "status" is ambiguous`

**Fixed:**
```sql
-- Before:
WHERE status = 'active'

-- After:
WHERE e.status = 'active'  -- Qualified with table alias
```

## Tenant Isolation Hierarchy (Implemented)

### 🔓 Super Admin
```
Role: super_admin
Tenant: Can be NULL or any tenant
Access: ALL data across ALL tenants
Filter: NONE (tenantId = null)
Flag: isSuperAdmin = true
```

**What they see:**
- All courses from all schools (with school names)
- All students from all schools
- All enrollments across schools
- System-wide statistics

### 🔒 School Admin
```
Role: school_admin
Tenant: Must have valid tenant_id
Access: Only their school's data
Filter: WHERE tenant_id = $1
Flag: isSuperAdmin = false
```

**What they see:**
- Only their school's courses
- Only their school's students
- Only their school's enrollments
- Their school's statistics

### 🔒 Instructor
```
Role: instructor
Tenant: Must have valid tenant_id
Access: Only their school's data + owned resources
Filter: WHERE tenant_id = $1
Flag: isSuperAdmin = false
```

**What they see:**
- Their school's courses (may have additional filters for owned)
- Students in their courses
- Their enrollments

### 🔒 Student
```
Role: student
Tenant: Must have valid tenant_id
Access: Only their school + enrolled courses
Filter: WHERE tenant_id = $1 + enrollments
Flag: isSuperAdmin = false
```

**What they see:**
- Courses they're enrolled in
- Their own progress
- Their school's public courses

---

## Security Guarantees

### ✅ Enforced:
1. **Super admin bypass** - Can see all tenants' data
2. **Tenant validation** - All non-super users must have tenant_id
3. **Query filtering** - WHERE clause added for tenant isolation
4. **Audit logging** - All tenant context logged with 🔓/🔒 emoji
5. **Error handling** - Rejects access attempts without tenant

### ✅ Prevented:
1. ❌ Users without tenant_id (except super_admin)
2. ❌ Cross-tenant data access (unless super_admin)
3. ❌ Tenant switching without re-auth
4. ❌ Client-side tenant selection
5. ❌ SQL injection via tenant_id

---

## Testing

### Test Super Admin Access:

```sql
-- 1. Create or update a user to super_admin
UPDATE user_profiles 
SET role = 'super_admin' 
WHERE email = 'your.email@example.com';

-- 2. Login and test
GET /api/courses
Expected: All courses from all tenants
Console: 🔓 Super Admin Access: No tenant restrictions
```

### Test Tenant Isolation:

```sql
-- 1. Login as school_admin
GET /api/courses
Expected: Only your school's courses
Console: 🔒 Tenant Isolation: {tenant_id}

-- 2. Try to access another tenant's course
GET /api/courses/{other_tenant_course_id}
Expected: 404 Not Found or 403 Forbidden
```

---

## Logs to Watch For

### Super Admin:
```
🔓 Super Admin Access: admin@example.com - No tenant restrictions
```

### School Admin/Others:
```
🔒 Tenant Isolation: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 (User: admin@school.com, Role: school_admin)
```

### Violations (if any):
```
🚫 Tenant Violation: User admin@schoolA.com (tenant: xxx) attempted to access resource from tenant: yyy
```
