# 🛡️ Certificate Tenant Isolation - FIXED

## ✅ Issues Identified and Fixed

### **Problem**: Student certificates page had no tenant isolation
- Students could potentially see certificates from other schools
- Hardcoded sample data instead of real API calls
- No proper role-based access controls

### **Solution**: Complete tenant isolation implementation

---

## 🔧 Frontend Fixes Applied

### **Updated `src/components/pages/CertificatesPage.tsx`**

#### 1. **Real API Integration** ✅
- Removed hardcoded sample data
- Added real API calls with proper error handling
- Implemented loading states and error messages

#### 2. **Role-Based Data Fetching** ✅
```typescript
// Students: Only their own certificates
if (role === 'student') {
  response = await api.get(`/api/certificates/student/${user?.id}`);
}

// Admins/Instructors: All certificates in their tenant
else {
  response = await api.get(`/api/certificates?${params.toString()}`);
}
```

#### 3. **UI Adaptations** ✅
- Search/filter controls only shown for admins/instructors
- Student view shows personalized messaging
- Proper navigation to certificate view page

#### 4. **Accessibility Improvements** ✅
- Added proper ARIA labels and titles
- Fixed all linting errors
- Enhanced keyboard navigation

## 🛡️ Backend Tenant Isolation (Already Implemented)

### **Certificate Routes with Tenant Isolation**

#### 1. **Student Certificate Access** ✅
```javascript
// GET /api/certificates/student/:studentId
router.get('/student/:studentId', asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  // Students can only view their own certificates
  if (req.user.role === 'student' && req.params.studentId !== req.user.id) {
    return res.status(403).json({
      success: false,
      error: 'Access denied: Can only view your own certificates'
    });
  }
  // ... rest of implementation
}));
```

#### 2. **Admin Certificate Access** ✅
```javascript
// GET /api/certificates (with filters)
// Only shows certificates from the user's tenant
// Super admins can see all certificates
```

#### 3. **Certificate Generation** ✅
```javascript
// POST /api/certificates/generate
// Validates enrollment ownership for students
// Tenant isolation enforced in service layer
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### **Test 1: Student Access**
1. **Login as student**
2. **Navigate to `/student/certificates`**
3. **Verify**: Only see own certificates
4. **Verify**: Cannot access other students' certificates

### **Test 2: Admin Access**
1. **Login as school admin**
2. **Navigate to `/school/certificates`**
3. **Verify**: See all certificates from their school only
4. **Verify**: Cannot see certificates from other schools

### **Test 3: Cross-Tenant Protection**
1. **Create certificates in different schools**
2. **Login as student from School A**
3. **Verify**: Cannot see certificates from School B
4. **Verify**: API returns 403 for unauthorized access
