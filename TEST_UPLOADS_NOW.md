## 🔍 Debugging Guide

### If Upload Still Fails

#### Check 1: Browser Console
```javascript
// Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
// Look for:
❌ Failed to fetch
❌ Network error
❌ 401 Unauthorized
❌ 403 Forbidden
❌ 500 Internal Server Error
```

#### Check 2: Network Tab
```
1. Open DevTools (F12) → Network tab
2. Upload a file
3. Look for request to /api/media/...
4. Click on it → Check:
   - Status: Should be 200 (success) or 4xx/5xx (error)
   - Response: Should show JSON response
   - Time: Should complete in 1-5 seconds
```

#### Check 3: Backend Terminal
```bash
# Should see:
POST /api/media/course-thumbnail/abc-123
🔒 Tenant Isolation: tenant_abc (User: admin@school.com, Role: school_admin)
📤 Uploading file to: tenants/school-name/courses/thumbnails/...
✅ File uploaded successfully: https://...

# Should NOT see:
❌ Middleware error
❌ Timeout
❌ Crash
❌ Silent failure
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Failed to fetch"
**Cause:** Backend server not running  
**Fix:** `npm run server`

### Issue 2: "401 Unauthorized"
**Cause:** Not logged in or token expired  
**Fix:** Logout and login again

### Issue 3: "403 Forbidden"
**Cause:** Tenant access denied  
**Fix:** Use correct admin account

### Issue 4: Still Spinning Forever
**Cause:** Backend route hanging  
**Fix:** 
1. Check backend terminal for error
2. Restart backend server
3. Share error logs

### Issue 5: "Image upload failed"
**Cause:** Vercel Blob error  
**Fix:**
1. Check BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN in .env
2. Run: `node server/test-vercel-blob.js`

## 📊 Success Indicators

### ✅ Everything Working
- Spinners show briefly then stop
- Modals close after save
- Toast messages appear
- Images show immediately
- No console errors
- Backend logs show successful uploads

### ❌ Still Broken
- Spinners never stop
- Modals stay open

## 🎯 Testing Priority

**Test in this order:**

1. **Course create WITHOUT image** (fastest to test)
   - If this fails → Backend issue, not upload issue

2. **Course create WITH image**
   - If this fails → Upload middleware issue

3. **School logo**
   - Already worked before

4. **Course edit + update image**
   - Tests update flow

5. **Profile picture** (if Settings page ready)
   - Tests self-service uploads

---

## 💡 What Fixed It

### The Problem
```javascript
// This is NOT middleware, it's a function that RETURNS middleware
export function validateTenantAccess(getResourceTenant) {
  return async (req, res, next) => { ... };
}

// Using it directly = WRONG
router.post('/path', validateTenantAccess, ...);  // ❌ Hangs!
```

### The Solution
```javascript
// This IS actual middleware
export async function tenantContext(req, res, next) {
  // Sets req.tenantId, req.isSuperAdmin
  next();
}

// Using it directly = CORRECT
router.post('/path', tenantContext, ...);  // ✅ Works!
```
