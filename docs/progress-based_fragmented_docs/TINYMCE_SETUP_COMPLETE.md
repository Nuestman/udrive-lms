# ✅ TinyMCE Implementation - Complete

## What Was Fixed

The TinyMCE rich text editor has been fully configured and is now functional!

### Changes Made

1. **Added Environment Variable Support**
   - The editor now uses `VITE_TINYMCE_API_KEY` from your `.env` file
   - No more hardcoded "no-api-key" placeholder

2. **Enhanced Editor Configuration**
   - Updated plugins: `anchor autolink charmap codesample emoticons image link lists media searchreplace table visualblocks wordcount code fullscreen`
   - Improved toolbar: Better organized with formatting, media, and layout controls
   - Added image upload handler (converts to base64 for now)
   - Enabled auto-save on content changes
   - Better content styling and line height

3. **Fixed Accessibility Issues**
   - Added proper ARIA labels to buttons and form controls
   - Improved screen reader support

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your TinyMCE API Key

If you don't have one yet:
1. Go to [TinyMCE Signup](https://www.tiny.cloud/auth/signup/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` file exists and contains:

```env
# TinyMCE (Rich Text Editor)
# Get free API key from: https://www.tiny.cloud/auth/signup/
VITE_TINYMCE_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
```

**Important:** Replace `your-actual-api-key-here` with your actual API key from TinyMCE.

### 3. Restart Development Server

After adding the API key to `.env`, restart your development server:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

## How to Test

1. **Login as an Instructor or Super Admin**
2. **Navigate to a Course** from your dashboard
3. **Click "Edit" on any lesson** or create a new one
4. **The TinyMCE editor should now load** without asking for an API key

## Editor Features

The editor now includes:

### Text Formatting
- **Bold, Italic, Underline, Strikethrough**
- Font family and size selection
- Text alignment options
- Line height controls

### Content Elements
- Numbered and bulleted lists
- Links and anchors
- Images (with upload support)
- Media embeds (videos, etc.)
- Tables
- Code samples
- Emoticons and special characters

### Tools
- Undo/Redo
- Search and replace
- Visual blocks
- Code view
- Fullscreen mode
- Remove formatting

## Troubleshooting

### Editor Still Asks for API Key

1. **Check your `.env` file exists** in the project root
2. **Verify the variable name** is exactly `VITE_TINYMCE_API_KEY` (case-sensitive)
3. **No spaces around the `=` sign**
4. **Restart the dev server** after changes

### API Key Not Working

1. **Verify your API key** is correct (copy-paste from TinyMCE dashboard)
2. **Check your domain** is approved in TinyMCE settings (localhost should work by default)
3. **Check the browser console** for any error messages

### Editor Not Loading

1. **Check internet connection** (TinyMCE loads from CDN)
2. **Check browser console** for errors
3. **Clear browser cache** and reload

## File Updated

- `src/components/lessons/LessonEditorModal.tsx`
  - Line 14: Added `TINYMCE_API_KEY` constant from environment
  - Line 192: Editor now uses `apiKey={TINYMCE_API_KEY}`
  - Lines 198-225: Enhanced configuration with better plugins and toolbar

## Next Steps

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

If you want to add more features later:

   - Update `images_upload_handler` to use the endpoint

2. **Custom Plugins**
