# 🏆 Certificate System Implementation - Complete Setup Guide

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema Updates**
- ✅ Added missing fields to certificates table (`enrollment_id`, `student_name`, `course_name`, etc.)
- ✅ Implemented proper tenant isolation with `tenant_id` field
- ✅ Added verification codes for public certificate verification
- ✅ Created indexes for optimal performance
- ✅ Added Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Created public verification view and function

### 2. **Backend Services (Complete CRUD)**
- ✅ **Generate Certificate**: Only for completed courses with proper tenant isolation
- ✅ **Get Certificate**: By ID with role-based access control
- ✅ **List Certificates**: With filtering, pagination, and tenant isolation
- ✅ **Update Status**: Approve/revoke certificates (admin/instructor only)
- ✅ **Delete Certificate**: Soft delete by revoking (admin/instructor only)
- ✅ **Certificate Stats**: Dashboard statistics with tenant isolation
- ✅ **Public Verification**: Verify certificates by verification code (no auth required)

### 3. **Backend Routes (Role-Based Access)**
- ✅ **Students**: Can generate/view their own certificates only
- ✅ **Instructors**: Can manage certificates for their courses
- ✅ **School Admins**: Can manage all certificates in their school
- ✅ **Super Admins**: Can manage all certificates across all schools
- ✅ **Public**: Can verify certificates using verification codes

### 4. **Frontend Components**
- ✅ **CertificateViewPage**: Student view with completion check
- ✅ **CertificateVerificationPage**: Public verification interface
- ✅ **CertificateManagementPage**: Admin/instructor management interface
- ✅ **CertificateGenerator**: PDF generation with QR codes
- ✅ **Updated App.tsx**: All certificate routes configured

### 5. **Key Features**
- ✅ **Tenant Isolation**: Certificates are properly isolated by school/tenant
- ✅ **Completion Requirement**: Certificates only accessible after course completion
- ✅ **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions for different user roles
- ✅ **Public Verification**: Anyone can verify certificate authenticity
- ✅ **Status Management**: Active, revoked, expired states
- ✅ **PDF Generation**: Professional certificates with QR codes
- ✅ **Bulk Operations**: Mass certificate management for admins

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Update Database Schema
```bash
# Run the certificate schema fix
psql -d your_database -f database/certificates-schema-fix.sql
```

### Step 2: Restart Backend Server
```bash
# The backend routes are already updated
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test the System

#### Test 1: Course Completion Flow
1. **Login as student**
2. **Complete a course** (mark all lessons as complete)
3. **Go to dashboard** → Should see "View Certificate" button
4. **Click "View Certificate"** → Should generate/display certificate

#### Test 2: Certificate Management (Admin)
1. **Login as school admin/instructor**
2. **Go to Certificates page**
3. **View certificate statistics**
4. **Search/filter certificates**
5. **Revoke/activate certificates**

#### Test 3: Public Verification
1. **Get a verification code** from any certificate
2. **Visit**: `http://localhost:5000/verify/[VERIFICATION_CODE]`
3. **Should show certificate details** without requiring login

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints (No Auth Required)
- `GET /api/certificates/verify/:verificationCode` - Verify certificate

### Protected Endpoints (Auth Required)

#### Students
- `POST /api/certificates/generate` - Generate certificate (own enrollments only)
- `GET /api/certificates/:id` - View certificate (own certificates only)
- `GET /api/certificates/student/:studentId` - List own certificates
- `GET /api/certificates/enrollment/:enrollmentId` - Get certificates for enrollment

#### Instructors & Admins
- `GET /api/certificates` - List all certificates (with filters)
- `GET /api/certificates/stats` - Get certificate statistics
- `PUT /api/certificates/:id/status` - Update certificate status
- `DELETE /api/certificates/:id` - Delete certificate

---

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Tenant Isolation
- ✅ All certificate queries include tenant_id filtering
- ✅ Students can only access their own certificates
- ✅ Admins can only access their school's certificates
- ✅ Super admins can access all certificates

### Role-Based Access Control
- ✅ **Students**: Limited to own certificates
- ✅ **Instructors**: Can manage course certificates
- ✅ **School Admins**: Can manage all school certificates
- ✅ **Super Admins**: Can manage all certificates

### Completion Validation
- ✅ Certificates only generated for completed courses
- ✅ Frontend checks enrollment status before showing certificate
- ✅ Backend validates completion status before generation

## 📊 Database Schema

### Certificates Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE certificates (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    course_id UUID REFERENCES courses(id),
    enrollment_id UUID REFERENCES enrollments(id),
    tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id),
    certificate_number TEXT UNIQUE,
    verification_code TEXT UNIQUE,
    student_name TEXT,
    course_name TEXT,
    school_name TEXT,
    instructor_name TEXT,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',
    issued_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    -- ... additional fields
);
```

### Key Indexes
- `idx_certificates_tenant_id` - Tenant isolation
- `idx_certificates_enrollment_id` - Enrollment lookup
- `idx_certificates_verification_code` - Public verification
- `idx_certificates_tenant_student` - Student queries
- `idx_certificates_tenant_course` - Course queries

---

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Generate Certificate (Student)
```javascript
// Only works for completed courses
const response = await api.post('/api/certificates/generate', {
  enrollment_id: 'enrollment-uuid'
});
```

### List Certificates (Admin)
```javascript
// With filters and pagination
const response = await api.get('/api/certificates?status=active&limit=50&search=john');
```

### Verify Certificate (Public)
```javascript
// No authentication required
const response = await fetch('/api/certificates/verify/VERIFY-12345678-ABCDEFGH');
```

### Update Certificate Status (Admin)
```javascript
await api.put('/api/certificates/cert-uuid/status', {
  status: 'revoked',
  notes: 'Certificate revoked due to course policy violation'
});
```
