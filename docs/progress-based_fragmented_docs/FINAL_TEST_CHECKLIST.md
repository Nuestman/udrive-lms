## 🎯 Expected Results

### What Should Work Now

✅ **Header Component**

After:  "Sarah Johnson"
```

✅ **Profile Page**
```
Before: 
  First Name: [ blank ]

## 🚨 If Something Still Doesn't Work

### 1. Clear Browser Cache
```
Ctrl + Shift + Delete
→ Select "Cached images and files"
→ Click "Clear data"
→ Refresh page
```

### 2. Check Browser Console (F12)
Look for JavaScript errors or failed API calls

### 3. Check Server Logs
Look in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running

### 4. Check Database
```bash
psql "your-connection-string" -c "
SELECT u.email, p.first_name, p.last_name 
FROM users u 
LEFT JOIN user_profiles p ON p.user_id = u.id 
WHERE p.first_name IS NULL;
"
```
Should return 0 rows (all users have profiles)

### 5. Verify All Files Saved
Ensure nodemon detected the changes:
```
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node server/index.js`
✅ Server is ready!
```

## 📊 Database Verification

Run this to verify migration succeeded:

```sql
-- Should show equal counts
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users) as users,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_profiles) as profiles;

-- Should return sample data
SELECT 
  u.email, 
  u.role, 
  p.first_name, 
  p.last_name, 
  p.phone 
FROM users u 
LEFT JOIN user_profiles p ON p.user_id = u.id 
LIMIT 5;

-- Should show all 12 foreign keys
SELECT 
  tc.table_name, 
  tc.constraint_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
  ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' 
  AND ccu.table_name = 'users';
```

## 📞 Quick Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Still see email in header | Browser cache | Clear cache, hard refresh |
| Profile still blank | Database not migrated | Check DB with verification queries |
| No toast messages | React hot toast not working | Check console for errors |
| Avatar upload fails | Wrong endpoint | Check useProfile.ts is saved |
| Courses page errors | Server not restarted | Check nodemon restarted |
