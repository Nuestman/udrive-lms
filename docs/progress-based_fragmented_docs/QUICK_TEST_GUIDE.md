# Quick Test Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Test What's Working Right Now!

### Your Backend Has 32 Endpoints Ready! ðŸš€

## Test 1: Change Your Role to Admin

You're currently a student. To test CRUD features:

### In pgAdmin, Run:
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET role = 'school_admin' 
WHERE email = 'nuestman17@gmail.com';
```

### Then:
1. **Logout** in browser
2. **Login** again
3. **Go to Courses**
4. **NOW you'll see:**
   - âœ… "Create Course" button
   - âœ… Edit/Delete in dropdown menus
   - âœ… Full admin powers!

## Test 2: Create a Course

1. **Click "Create Course"**
2. **Fill in:**
   - Title: "My First Real Course"
   - Description: "This saves to PostgreSQL!"
   - Duration: 8 weeks
   - Price: 499.99
3. **Click "Create Course"**

### Watch Your Terminal:
```
[0] POST /api/courses
[0] INSERT INTO courses...
[0] Executed query { duration: 10-20ms, rows: 1 }
```

### Check Browser:
âœ… Course appears in list immediately!

### Verify in pgAdmin:
```sql
SELECT * FROM courses 
WHERE title = 'My First Real Course';
```

âœ… There it is in the database!

---

## Test 3: Edit the Course

1. **Hover over your new course**
2. **Click â‹® (three dots)**
3. **Click "Edit Course"**
4. **Change title** to "My Edited Course"
5. **Click "Save Changes"**

### Watch Terminal:
```
[0] PUT /api/courses/[uuid]
[0] UPDATE courses...
```

### Result:
âœ… Title updates immediately!
âœ… Refresh page - still shows new title!

---

## Test 4: Delete the Course

1. **Click â‹® on your test course**
2. **Click "Delete"**
3. **Confirm**

### Watch Terminal:
```
[0] DELETE /api/courses/[uuid]
```

### Result:
âœ… Course disappears!
âœ… Removed from database!

---

## Test 5: Publish a Course

1. **Create a course** (starts as "draft")
2. **Click â‹® â†’ "Publish"**
3. **Watch status change** to "Published" (green badge)

---

## Test 6: Test Students API

### In Browser Console (F12):
```javascript
// Get all students
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/students', {
  credentials: 'include'
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);

// Should return: { success: true, data: [array of students] }
```

### Or In pgAdmin:
```sql
SELECT id, email, first_name, last_name, role, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM enrollments WHERE student_id = users.id) as enrollments
FROM users 
WHERE role = 'student';
```

Shows all students in database!

---

## Test 7: Test Enrollments API

### Browser Console:
```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/enrollments', {
  credentials: 'include'
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);
```

Returns all enrollments!

## What's Working (Proven by Logs)

From your terminal, I can see:
```
âœ… Backend running on port 5000
âœ… Database connected
âœ… GET /api/courses returning 3 courses
âœ… Query executing in 3-7ms
âœ… Tenant isolation working
âœ… Authentication working
âœ… Session persisting
```

**This is a REAL system!** ðŸŽŠ
