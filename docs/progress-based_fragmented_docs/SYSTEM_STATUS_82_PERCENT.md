## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Tenant Isolation Rules:

| Role | Tenant Required | Access Scope | Bypass Filters |
|------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Super Admin** | ❌ No | All tenants | ✅ Yes |
| **School Admin** | ✅ Yes | Own school only | ❌ No |
| **Instructor** | ✅ Yes | Own school only | ❌ No |
| **Student** | ✅ Yes | Enrolled only | ❌ No |

### Query Patterns:

**Super Admin Queries:**
```sql
SELECT c.*, t.name as school_name
FROM courses c
LEFT JOIN tenants t ON c.tenant_id = t.id
-- NO WHERE clause - all data
```

**School Admin Queries:**
```sql
SELECT c.*
FROM courses c
WHERE c.tenant_id = $1
-- Strict filtering - only their school
```

### Logging:
- 🔓 = Super admin (no restrictions)
- 🔒 = Tenant scoped (filtered)
- 🚫 = Violation attempt (blocked)
