# 🔐 Tenant-Aware Authentication - COMPLETE!

## Status: **Authentication Fully Aligned with Tenant Isolation** ✅

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Students Page Dropdown** - Fixed! ✅
**Problem**: Dropdown was cut off by table overflow
**Solution**:
- Changed `overflow-hidden` to `overflow-visible`
- Added wrapper `<div>` with `overflow-x-auto`
- Increased dropdown z-index to `z-50`

**Result**: Dropdown now shows completely!

### 2. **Tenant-Aware Auth System** - Complete! ✅

**Three Signup Flows:**

#### Flow 1: Regular Signup (Join Existing School)
```
Path: /signup
Requires: Subdomain OR tenant_id, Email, Password, Name
Creates: User in existing school
Route: POST /api/auth/signup
```

#### Flow 2: School Creation Signup (NEW!) 🆕
```
Path: /signup/school
Requires: School details + Admin account details
Creates: New school + School admin user
Route: POST /api/auth/signup/school
```

#### Flow 3: Super Admin Signup (Restricted)
```
Path: /signup/super-admin (optional)
Requires: Email, Password, Name
Creates: Super admin (no tenant)
Route: POST /api/auth/signup/super-admin
Restriction: Only works if no super admin exists

## 🔒 Tenant Isolation Alignment

### Signup → Tenant Assignment:

| Signup Type | Tenant Assignment | Role | Access Level |
|-------------|-------------------|------|--------------|
| **School Creation** | Creates new tenant | school_admin | Own school only |
| **Regular Signup** | Joins existing tenant | student/instructor | Own school only |
| **Super Admin** | NULL (no tenant) | super_admin | ALL schools |

### After Signup → Login → Middleware:
```
Login with credentials
  → JWT token (includes tenant_id or null)
  → tenantContext middleware
  → if super_admin: req.tenantId = null, req.isSuperAdmin = true
  → else: req.tenantId = user.tenant_id, req.isSuperAdmin = false
  → Services filter data accordingly
```
