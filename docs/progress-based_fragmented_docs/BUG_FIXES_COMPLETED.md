# üêõ Bug Fixes - Lessons & Goals

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ‚úÖ Mark as Complete Not Working
**Error:** `column "updated_at" of relation "lesson_progress" does not exist`

**Root Cause:** The `lesson_progress` table was missing `updated_at` and `created_at` columns.

**Fix:**
- Created `database/fix-lesson-progress.sql`
- Added `updated_at` and `created_at` columns
- Created trigger to auto-update `updated_at`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Run in pgAdmin successfully

```sql
ALTER TABLE lesson_progress 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW();

ALTER TABLE lesson_progress 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW();
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Create Goal Button Inactive
**Problem:** "Create Goal" button in student progress page was inactive/hardcoded.

**Fix:**
- Created `goals` table in database (`database/fix-goals-table.sql`)
- Created Goals Service (`server/services/goals.service.js`)
- Created Goals Routes (`server/routes/goals.js`)
- Added Goals API to server (`app.use('/api/goals', goalsRoutes)`)
- Created CreateGoalModal component (`src/components/student/CreateGoalModal.tsx`)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Backend complete, frontend ready

**New API Endpoints:**
```
GET    /api/goals              - Get student's goals
GET    /api/goals/:id          - Get specific goal
POST   /api/goals              - Create new goal
PUT    /api/goals/:id          - Update goal
DELETE /api/goals/:id          - Delete goal
```
