# Toast Notifications & File Naming Improvements - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎯 Improvements Made

### 1. ✅ Professional Toast Notifications

**Before:** Browser `alert()` popups  
**After:** Beautiful toast notifications

#### Created Toast System
**New File:** `src/contexts/ToastContext.tsx` (131 lines)

**Features:**
- ✅ 4 toast types: success, error, warning, info
- ✅ Auto-dismiss with configurable duration
- ✅ Slide-in animation from right
- ✅ Stackable toasts
- ✅ Close button
- ✅ Color-coded with icons
- ✅ Responsive design

**API:**
```typescript
const toast = useToast();

toast.success('Operation completed!');        // Green, 5s
toast.error('Something went wrong!');         // Red, 7s
toast.warning('Partial success');             // Yellow, 6s
toast.info('Information message');            // Blue, 5s
```

#### Visual Design:
```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✅ School and logo created!    │ [×]
└────────────────────────────────┘
  Green background, slides in from right
  Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds
```

---

### 2. ✅ Human-Readable File & Directory Naming

**Before:**
```
Path: /tenants/a1b2c3d4-uuid-here/logos/
File: original-filename_2025-01-15_14-30-45.jpg
```

**After:**
```
Path: /tenants/elite-driving/logos/
File: elite-driving_logo_2025-01-15_14-30-45.jpg
```

#### Changes Made:

**Directory Structure:**
- Uses **school name** instead of UUID
- Sanitized for URL-safety
- Human-readable and organized

**File Naming:**
- Format: `{tenant-name}_{category}_{timestamp}.ext`
- Example: `elite-driving_logo_2025-01-15_14-30-45.png`
- Examples by category:
  - Logo: `elite-driving_logo_2025-01-15.png`
  - Avatar: `elite-driving_avatar_2025-01-15.jpg`
  - Thumbnail: `elite-driving_thumbnail_2025-01-15.jpg`
  - Assignment: `elite-driving_assignment_2025-01-15.pdf`
