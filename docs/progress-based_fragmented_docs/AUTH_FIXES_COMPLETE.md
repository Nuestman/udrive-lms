# Authentication Fixes Complete! âœ…

## What Was Fixed

### 1. âœ… Dynamic User Profile
**Before:** Header showed hardcoded "Sarah Johnson"  
**After:** Shows actual logged-in user's name

**Code changes:**
- DashboardLayout now uses `useAuth()` to get real user
- `getUserName()` function returns first_name + last_name or email
- Avatar generated dynamically from user's name

### 2. âœ… Proper Logout Function
**Before:** Logout was just an anchor tag that did nothing  
**After:** Properly calls `signOut()` and redirects to login

**Code changes:**
- Added `handleLogout()` function in DashboardLayout
- Calls `signOut()` from AuthContext
- Navigates to `/login` after logout
- Sidebar updated to use button with onClick handler

### 3. âœ… React Router Navigation
**Before:** Sidebar used `<a href>` tags (full page reload)  
**After:** Uses `<Link>` for client-side routing

**Code changes:**
- Imported `Link` from react-router-dom
- Changed all navigation items to use `<Link to={...}>`
- Faster, smoother navigation

## Test Now

### See Your Real Name
1. **Look at the header** - You should see your signup name (not "Sarah Johnson")
2. **Check the avatar** - Auto-generated from your name
3. **Verify role** - Shows "Student" (your actual role)

### Test Logout
1. **Click "Sign out"** in sidebar
2. **Should redirect** to login page
3. **Session cleared** - Can't access dashboard anymore
4. **Must login again** to access

### Test Navigation
1. **Click different sidebar items** - Instant navigation
2. **No page reload** - Client-side routing
3. **Active state** - Current page highlighted

## What Now Works

âœ… **Real user data** from PostgreSQL database  
âœ… **Dynamic profile** in header  
âœ… **Proper logout** with redirect  
âœ… **Client-side routing** with React Router  
âœ… **Session management** working correctly

## The Test Users Issue

**Old test users still have placeholder passwords** because you ran SQL manually.

**Two options:**

### Option 1: Fix Test Users
1. Update `.env` with your actual PostgreSQL password
2. Run: `node database/fix-passwords.js`
3. Then you can login with test accounts

### Option 2: Keep Using Your Account
Your signup account works perfectly! Just use that.

## Reload the App

Since the frontend is already running (`npm run dev`), you need to:

1. **Refresh your browser** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. **See changes take effect**
3. **Test logout**
4. **Login again**

The changes are in the code now, just need browser refresh!

## Try These Tests

### Test 1: Check Your Name
- **Expected:** Your first and last name in header (or email if no name)
- **Not:** "Sarah Johnson" or "Jane Smith"

### Test 2: Logout
- **Click:** "Sign out" in sidebar
- **Expected:** Redirected to `/login`
- **Not:** Staying on dashboard

### Test 3: Try Accessing Dashboard Without Login
- After logout, try going to `/student/dashboard`
- **Expected:** Redirected to login (protected route)

### Test 4: Login Again
- Login with your signup credentials
- **Expected:** See dashboard with your name again
