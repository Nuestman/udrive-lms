## 🐛 Known Issue: Authentication Error

**Issue:** Logo upload shows "Not authenticated" after school creation/edit

**Debugging Added:**
- ✅ Frontend console logging
- ✅ Backend terminal logging
- ✅ Detailed error messages

**To Debug:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Try to create/edit school with logo
3. Check console messages starting with 🔍
4. Share the output for further investigation

**Likely Causes:**
- Token might not be properly saved after login
- Token format issue in multipart request
- CORS or header issue

## 🧪 Test Command Added

```bash
# Test Vercel Blob connection anytime
npm run test:blob
```

This command will:
- Check if token is configured
