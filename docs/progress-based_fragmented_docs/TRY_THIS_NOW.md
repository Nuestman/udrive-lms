# Try This Now - Final Fix!

## What I Fixed

1. ✅ **Installed nodemon** - Keeps backend alive (like your working apps)
2. ✅ **Updated scripts** - `npm run dev` now starts both (single command!)
3. ✅ **Fixed database config** - Supports `DATABASE_URL` format (like your working app)
4. ✅ **Added nodemon.json** - Proper configuration

---

## Run This Command

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## What You Should See

```
[0] [nodemon] starting `node server/index.js`
[0] [dotenv] injecting env...
[0] 🚀 Server running on http://localhost:5000
[0] 📡 API available at http://localhost:5000/api
[0] 🔐 Auth endpoints at http://localhost:5000/api/auth
[0] ✅ Connected to PostgreSQL database: udrive-from-bolt
[0] ✅ Database connected successfully
[0] 🎯 Server is ready! Keep this terminal open.
[1] 
[1] VITE v5.4.8  ready in 876 ms
[1] ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
[1] ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

**IMPORTANT:** Both `[0]` (backend) and `[1]` (frontend) should show up and **STAY RUNNING**.

If they appear then disappear, there's an issue.

---

## Test Login

Once both are running:

1. **Open:** http://localhost:5173
2. **Click:** "Sign In"
3. **Enter:**
   ```
   Email: schooladmin@premier.com
   Password: password123
   ```
4. **Click:** "Sign In"

---

## If Backend Still Exits

The terminal should show what's happening. Look for:

**Backend logs (should stay):**
```
[0] 🚀 Server running on http://localhost:5000
[0] [nodemon] watching...
```

**If you see this (bad):**
```
[0] npm run server exited with code 0
```

Then something is still causing it to exit.

---

## Check Your Terminal

Your terminal might show additional errors that I can't see. Look for:
- Database connection errors
- Port already in use errors
- Module import errors
- Any red error messages

**Send me what you see!**

---

## Alternative: Run Separately to Debug

If `npm run dev` has issues, try running separately:

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
npm run server
```

**Terminal 2 (new terminal):**
```bash
npm run client
```

This way you can see each one's output clearly.

---

## Expected Behavior

✅ **Backend stays running** (nodemon keeps it alive)  
✅ **Frontend stays running** (Vite dev server)  
✅ **Login works** (backend authenticates)  
✅ **No NetworkError** (both connected)  

---

**Try running `npm run dev` now and let me know exactly what you see!** 🚀

I need to see the terminal output to diagnose if something's still wrong.
