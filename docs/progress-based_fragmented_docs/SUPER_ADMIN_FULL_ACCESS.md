## Next: Make Super Admin See EVERYTHING

To fully implement super admin viewing all data across tenants, we need to modify the backend tenant middleware:

**Current:** Super admin queries filtered by `tenant_id`
**Needed:** Super admin queries should see ALL tenants

This requires:
1. Update tenant middleware to skip tenant filtering for super_admin
2. Update queries to include tenant information in results
3. Add tenant selection dropdown for super admin

**Super Admin now has access to all navigation!** 🎉
