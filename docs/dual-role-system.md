# Dual-Role Learning System

## Overview

The Dual-Role Learning System is a revolutionary feature that allows elevated roles (instructors, school admins, super admins) to participate as students in courses while maintaining their administrative capabilities. This creates a more flexible and comprehensive learning experience for all user types.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

### Universal Enrollment
- **Cross-Role Enrollment**: Any user can enroll in courses regardless of their primary role
- **Role-Aware Access**: System respects both administrative and student permissions
- **Flexible Permissions**: Users can act as both administrators and students simultaneously

### Student View Mode
- **Full Student Experience**: Elevated roles can access the complete student learning interface
- **Authentic Learning**: Same learning experience as regular students
- **Progress Tracking**: Full progress tracking and completion features
- **Certificate Access**: Access to certificates upon course completion

### Seamless View Switching
- **Student View Button**: Easy access to student learning experience from course management
- **Back to Management**: Quick return to administrative view from student experience
- **Context-Aware Navigation**: Navigation that understands both administrative and student contexts

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### For Instructors
1. **Course Management**: Create, edit, and manage courses as usual
2. **Student Enrollment**: Enroll in any published course as a student
3. **Learning Experience**: Access full student learning interface with lessons, quizzes, and progress tracking
4. **View Switching**: Seamlessly switch between instructor and student views

### For School Admins
1. **Administrative Functions**: Manage schools, users, and system settings
2. **Course Participation**: Enroll in courses to experience the student journey
3. **Quality Assurance**: Test courses from a student perspective
4. **Dual Context**: Maintain administrative oversight while learning

### For Super Admins
1. **System Management**: Full system administration capabilities
2. **Cross-Tenant Learning**: Can enroll in courses across different tenants and organizations
3. **Global System Testing**: Test the learning experience from a student perspective across all organizations
4. **Multi-Organization Validation**: Validate features and courses across different tenants
5. **Universal Course Access**: Access any course in the system regardless of tenant
6. **Global Oversight**: Maintain system-wide control while participating in learning

## ðŸŽ¨ User Interface

### Universal Enrollment Button
The enrollment button adapts based on user role and enrollment status:

- **Before Enrollment**: Shows "Enroll", "Take Course", or "Enroll as Student" based on role
- **After Enrollment (0% progress)**: Shows "Start Course" with play icon
- **After Enrollment (with progress)**: Shows "Continue Learning" with play icon
- **Completed Course**: Shows "View Certificate" with award icon

### Student View Button
Located in course management interface:
- **Blue button with play icon**: "Student View"
- **Smart Navigation**: Automatically navigates to first lesson
- **Fallback Handling**: Shows appropriate messages if no content exists

### Back to Management Button
Located in student learning interface (for elevated roles):
- **Gray button with settings icon**: "Back to Management"
- **Quick Return**: Returns to course management view
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains current course context

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### New Components

#### UniversalEnrollmentButton
```typescript
interface UniversalEnrollmentButtonProps {
  courseId: string;
  courseTitle: string;
  isEnrolled?: boolean;
  enrollmentProgress?: number;
  enrollmentStatus?: string;
  onEnrollmentChange?: () => void;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
}
```

**Features:**
- Adaptive button text based on enrollment status
- Progress-aware actions
- Role-specific messaging
- Real-time state updates

#### UniversalStudentDashboard
```typescript
interface UniversalStudentDashboardProps {
  className?: string;
}
```

**Features:**
- Cross-role student dashboard
- Enrollment tracking for all user types
- Progress visualization
- Course action buttons

### Enhanced API Endpoints

#### Universal Enrollment API
```typescript
export const enrollmentsApi = {
  getAll: (params?: {
    student_id?: string;
    course_id?: string;
    status?: string;
  }) => Promise<{ success: boolean; data: any[] }>,
  
  create: (data: {
    student_id?: string; // Optional - defaults to current user
    course_id: string;
  }) => Promise<{ success: boolean; data: any; message: string }>,
  
  // ... other methods
};
```

### Routing System

#### New Routes Added
- `/school/courses/:courseId/lessons/:lessonId` â†’ `StudentLessonViewer` (for school admins)
- `/admin/courses/:courseId/lessons/:lessonId` â†’ `StudentLessonViewer` (for super admins)
- `/instructor/courses/:courseId/lessons/:lessonId` â†’ `StudentLessonViewer` (for instructors)

#### Role-Aware Navigation
```typescript
const getBasePath = (role: string) => {
  switch (role) {
    case 'student': return '/student';
    case 'instructor': return '/instructor';
    case 'school_admin': return '/school';
    case 'super_admin': return '/admin';
    default: return '/school';
  }
};
```

#### Super Admin Specific Routing
Super Admins have enhanced routing capabilities:
- **Global Course Access**: `/admin/courses` - Access all courses across all tenants
- **Cross-Tenant Learning**: `/admin/courses/:courseId/lessons/:lessonId` - Student learning experience
- **Universal Enrollment**: Can enroll in courses from any organization
- **Global Dashboard**: Access learning dashboard showing courses from all tenants
- **Cross-Tenant Analytics**: View learning progress across multiple organizations

## ðŸ“Š Benefits

- Administrative access doesn't compromise student privacy
- All existing privacy protections remain active

### Audit Trail
- All dual-role activities are properly logged
- Clear distinction between administrative and student actions
- Comprehensive audit trail for compliance
