# Image Uploads - Revised Strategy ✅

## 🎯 Philosophy: Self-Service vs Admin-Controlled

### ✅ Correct Approach

**Self-Service Uploads (Users manage their own):**
- 👤 **Profile Avatars** → Users update via Settings → Profile
  - Students upload their own avatars
  - Instructors upload their own avatars
  - Admins upload their own avatars
  - **Route:** `POST /api/media/avatar` (uses `req.user.id`)

**Admin-Controlled Uploads (Content & Resources):**
- 🏫 **School Logos** → School/Super admins manage
  - **Route:** `POST /api/media/tenant-logo/:tenantId`
- 📚 **Course Thumbnails** → Instructors/Admins manage courses
  - **Route:** `POST /api/media/course-thumbnail/:courseId`
- 📝 **Lesson Media** → Instructors/Admins manage content
  - **Route:** `POST /api/media/lesson-media/:lessonId`

### ❌ Previous Incorrect Approach

**What we tried but doesn't make sense:**
- ❌ Admin uploading avatar for instructor (during create/edit)
- ❌ Admin uploading avatar for student (during create/edit)
- ❌ One user updating another user's profile picture

**Why it's wrong:**
- Privacy concerns (admins shouldn't manage personal photos)
- UX complexity (users should control their own images)
- Backend complexity (requires user ID in URL, permission checks)
- Security concerns (cross-user file uploads)

### For End Users (Instructors/Students)
**Updating Your Profile:**
> To update your profile picture:
> 1. Click your name in the top right
> 2. Select "Settings" or "Profile"
> 3. Click "Upload Avatar"
> 4. Select your image
> 5. Save changes

## 💡 Key Takeaway

**Image uploads should follow the principle:**
> "Users manage personal data (avatars). Admins manage content resources (course thumbnails, school logos)."

This creates clear boundaries, better UX, and simpler code! 🎉
