# 🎨 All Dashboards Enhanced + Token Bug Fixed!

## Issues Resolved:

### 1. ✅ Token Error Fixed!
**Problem**: `Invalid or expired token` on /admin/schools
**Root Cause**: Auth middleware was looking for `decoded.userId` but JWT contains `decoded.id`
**Fix**:
```javascript
// Before (broken):
const result = await query(..., [decoded.userId]);
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^ Wrong!

// After (fixed):
const result = await query(..., [decoded.id]);
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^ Correct!
```

**Result**: Authentication now works perfectly for all routes!
