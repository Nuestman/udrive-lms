## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Student Views Lesson
```
Student clicks "Start Course"
  → Navigate to /student/courses/{courseId}/lessons/{lessonId}
  → StudentLessonViewer loads
  → Fetches lesson content
  → Displays with formatting
  → Shows completion status
```

### 2. Student Completes Lesson
```
Click "Mark as Complete"
  → POST /api/progress/lesson/{lessonId}/complete
  → Insert/Update lesson_progress table
  → Calculate: (completed lessons / total lessons) * 100
  → UPDATE enrollments SET progress_percentage = X
  → If 100% → Set status = 'completed'
  → Return updated progress
  → UI updates immediately!
```

### 3. Progress Calculation
```sql
-- Count total lessons in course
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lessons l
JOIN modules m ON l.module_id = m.id
WHERE m.course_id = $1

-- Count completed lessons for student
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lesson_progress lp
JOIN lessons l ON lp.lesson_id = l.id
JOIN modules m ON l.module_id = m.id
WHERE m.course_id = $1 
  AND lp.student_id = $2 
  AND lp.status = 'completed'

-- Calculate percentage
progress = (completed / total) * 100
```
